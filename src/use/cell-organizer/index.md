summary: "CellOrganizer for Galaxy is an open source software that can generate quantitatively realistic synthetic images that reflect the underlying cell population. The generated models of subcellular location learnt from a collection of images, also capture its variation from cell to cell. The trained models contain three components: a nuclear model, a cell shape model, and a protein distribution object model."
